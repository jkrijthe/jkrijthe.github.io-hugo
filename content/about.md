As an assistant professor in the [Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics](https://prb.tudelft.nl) group of TU Delft (Delft University of Technology) I work on methodology and applications of statistical machine learning. Currently, I am particularly interested in causal inference, philosophy of statistics/data science, semi-supervised learning, model evaluation/selection, domain adaptation and missing data.

Previously I worked as a postdoc in the [Data Science group](http://www.ru.nl/datascience/) of Radboud University Nijmegen on predictive and causal models for Parkinson's disease.

During my PhD I studied robust methods to do semi-supervised learning, that is: supervised models that can use additional unlabeled data with the property that, with high probability, performance is better than the original supervised model. My PhD research was supervised by [Prof. Marco Loog](http://prlab.tudelft.nl/users/marco-loog/) (affiliated with the Pattern Recognition Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology), [Prof. Joost Kok](http://www.liacs.nl/~joost/) (LUMC) and [Prof. Eline Slagboom](http://www.molepi.nl/en/people/people_item/t/p_eline_slagboom) (LUMC) and was funded by the [COMMIT research program](http://commit-nl.nl/). During my PhD I was affiliated with the Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics group of Delft University of Technology and the Department of Molecular Epidemiology of the Leiden University Medical Center.
