As a postdoc in the [Data Science group](http://www.ru.nl/datascience/) of Radboud University Nijmegen, I work on statistical machine learning and pattern recognition. I am particularly interested in: semi-supervised learning, model selection, meta-learning and approaches to deal with missing or noisy data.

I'm currently finishing up my PhD research project studying robust methods to do semi-supervised learning, that is: supervised models that can use additional unlabeled data with the property that, with high probability, performance is better than the original supervised model.

My PhD research was supervised by [Prof. Joost Kok](http://www.liacs.nl/~joost/) (LUMC) and [Prof. Marco Loog](http://prlab.tudelft.nl/users/marco-loog/) (affiliated with the Pattern Recognition Laboratory of the Delft University of Technology) and funded by the [COMMIT research program](http://commit-nl.nl/). During my PhD I was affiliated with the Pattern Recognition & Bioinformatics group of Delft University of Technology and the Department of Molecular Epidemiology of the Leiden University Medical Center.
